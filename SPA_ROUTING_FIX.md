# SPA Routing Fix Documentation

## Problem

Users accessing direct routes like `https://www.pubint.site/services` were getting 404 errors instead of being served the correct page. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the server doesn't know how to handle client-side routes.

## Root Cause

The server was looking for actual files at paths like `/services` instead of serving the main `index.html` file and letting React Router handle the routing on the client side.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`

- Added proper routing configuration to handle all routes and redirect them to `index.html`
- Separated API routes to ensure backend functionality remains intact

### 2. Enhanced `_redirects` (Netlify)

- Updated the redirect rules for better SPA handling
- Preserved API route handling

### 3. Updated `render.yaml`

- Added frontend static site configuration
- Included proper rewrite rules for SPA routing

### 4. Added Server Configuration Files

- **`.htaccess`** - For Apache servers
- **`web.config`** - For IIS servers
- These ensure the fix works across different hosting platforms

### 5. Enhanced React Router

- Added a catch-all route (`*`) that redirects unknown routes to the home page
- This provides a fallback for any routes not explicitly defined

## How It Works

1. When a user visits `/services` directly, the server receives the request
2. Instead of looking for a `/services` file, the server configuration redirects to `/index.html`
3. The browser loads the React app from `index.html`
4. React Router takes over and displays the correct component for `/services`
5. The URL remains as `/services` in the browser

## Benefits

- ✅ Direct route access now works (e.g., `yoursite.com/services`)
- ✅ Bookmarks and shared links work correctly
- ✅ Page refreshes maintain the current route
- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs are preserved
- ✅ Works across multiple hosting platforms

## Deployment Notes

After deploying these changes:

1. Clear browser cache to ensure the new configuration is loaded
2. Test all routes by accessing them directly
3. Verify that API routes still function correctly
4. Check that the 404 catch-all route redirects to home appropriately
